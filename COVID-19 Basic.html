<p><i>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).<br><br>

Stay informed!</i></p>

<br><p><u><h2 id="Symptoms" style="color:orange;"><center> Symptoms of the disease </center></h2></u><br><br>
</p>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 4 to 5 days. However, it can range anywhere from 2 to 14 days.

Not everyone with a SARS-CoV-2 infection will feel unwell. It’s possible to have the virus and not develop symptoms. When symptoms are present, they’re typically mild and develop slowly.

The most common symptoms are:

<ol>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
</ol>
Some people with COVID-19 may sometimes experience additional symptoms, such as:

<ol>
<li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Muscle aches and pains</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Chills</li>
<li>Repeated shaking to go along with the chills</li>
<li>Loss of taste or smell</li>
</ol>

Some observations suggest that respiratory symptoms may worsen in the second week of illness. This appears to occur after around 8 days.If you have any of the main symptoms of coronavirus:
<ul>
<li>Get a test to check if you have coronavirus as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Stay at home and do not have visitors until you get your test result – only leave your home to have a test.</li>
<li>Anyone you live with, and anyone in your support bubble, must also stay at home until you get your result.</li>
</ul>

<ol><li><u><b>Wash your hands often</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
<li>It’s especially important to wash:</li>
<ul><li>Before eating or preparing food</li>
<li>Before touching your face</li>
<li>After using the restroom</li>
<li>After leaving a public place</li>
<li>After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing</li>
<li>After handling your mask</li>
<li>After changing a diaper</li>
<li>After caring for someone sick</li>
<li>After touching animals or pets</li></ul>
<li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry</li><li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li></ul><br>

<li><u><b>Avoid close contact</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<ul><li>If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.</li></ul>
<li>Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.</li>
<ul><li>Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.</li>
<li>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.</li>
<li>Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li></ul></ul><br>

<li><u><b>Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.</li>
<li>The mask is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.</li>
<li>Everyone should wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don’t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.</li>
<ul><li>Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.</li></ul>
<li>Do NOT use a mask meant for a healthcare worker. Currently, surgical masks and N95 respirators are critical supplies that should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders.</li>
<li>Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The mask is not a substitute for social distancing.</li></ul><br>


<li><u><b>Cover coughs and sneezes</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit.</li>
<li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>
<li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li></ul><br>

<li><u><b>Clean and disinfect</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li>
<li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them. Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.</li>
<li>Then, use a household disinfectant. Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.</li></ul><br>

<li><u><b>Monitor Your Health Daily</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.</li>
<ul><li>Especially important if you are running essential errands, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.</li></ul>
<li>Take your temperature if symptoms develop.</li>
<ul><li>Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.</li></ul></ul></ol><br>

<p><u><h2 id="Tests" style="color:orange;"><center> Different Tests Available </center></h2></u></p>

<ul>
<li><u><b>PCR testing</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>PCR tests are used to directly detect the presence of an antigen, rather than the presence of the body’s immune response, or antibodies. By detecting viral RNA, which will be present in the body before antibodies form or symptoms of the disease are present, the tests can tell whether or not someone has the virus very early on.</li><br>
<li>PCR gives us a good indication of who is infected. They can be isolated and get in contact with people they’ve been in touch with so they can be quarantined too, just in case. That’s the true advantage of the current major diagnostic tests, you can break that transmission chain and get a clearer picture of what’s happening.</li><br>
<li>It’s worth noting that PCR tests can be very labour intensive, with several stages at which errors may occur between sampling and analysis. False negatives can occur up to 30% of the time with different PCR tests, meaning they’re more useful for confirming the presence of an infection than giving a patient the all-clear.</li><br></ul>

<li><u><b>Saliva tests</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>Coronavirus saliva tests are a new type of PCR diagnostic for COVID-19. Saliva testing “does depend on standard PCR technology, and it does require some manual labor in order to move it through the steps of the test.</li><br><li>SalivaDirect, the test from Yale, also does not require proprietary chemical reagents or test tubes, which its developers hope will help ease supply and access issues</li></ul><br>

<li><u><b>Antigen tests</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>Like PCR tests, antigen tests usually require a nose or throat swab. But unlike PCR tests, which look for genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, antigen tests look for proteins that live on the virus’ surface. This process is a little less labor-intensive than PCR testing, since there isn’t as much chemistry involved, but it’s also less sensitive. Much like with rapid genetic tests, some experts argue that fast-moving antigen tests could help ease testing bottlenecks enough to compensate for their reduced accuracy.</li></ul><br>

<li><u><b>Antibody tests</b></u></li><br>
<ul><li>Unlike the other tests listed here, antibody tests aren’t meant to pick up on current infection with SARS-CoV-2. Rather, they search the blood for antibodies, proteins the body makes in response to an infection that may provide immunity against the same disease in the future. These tests look for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies to see if you’ve previously had coronavirus.</li><br><li>Right now, antibody tests can’t do much except satisfy curiosity.Even if the results are accurate, scientists do not yet know how well or for how long coronavirus antibodies protect someone from a future case of COVID-19. A positive antibody test result does not mean you can’t get COVID-19 again, at least as far as current science suggests. Wide-scale antibody testing is useful for researchers, since it could inform estimates about how many people have actually had COVID-19 and help scientists learn more about if or how antibodies bestow immunity to coronavirus.</li></ul><br>
